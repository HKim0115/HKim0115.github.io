#  OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)

The **OSI Model** is a standard framework that defines how data is transmitted across a network.  
It consists of **7 layers**, each responsible for specific networking tasks.  
This model ensures that different systems and devices can communicate effectively, regardless of their underlying architecture.

## 7 Layers of the OSI Model

| Layer | Name              | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 7️⃣   | **Application**   | Closest to the user. Interfaces with software (e.g. web browsers, email clients). |
| 6️⃣   | **Presentation**  | Formats data (e.g. encryption, compression, encoding). |
| 5️⃣   | **Session**       | Manages sessions and connections between devices. |
| 4️⃣   | **Transport**     | Ensures reliable delivery using TCP/UDP. Handles error checking and data flow. |
| 3️⃣   | **Network**       | Determines the best path for data. Uses IP addressing and routing. |
| 2️⃣   | **Data Link**     | Manages MAC addresses and frame delivery on the same network (e.g. via switches). |
| 1️⃣   | **Physical**      | Transfers raw bits over physical medium (e.g. cables, wireless signals). |

## How It Works

When data is sent:

1. It travels **from Layer 7 (Application)** down to **Layer 1 (Physical)**, with each layer adding its own information (Encapsulation).
2. On the receiving side, the data goes **from Layer 1 back up to Layer 7**, stripping away layer information (Decapsulation).

## Why Is OSI Important?

- **Standardization**: Allows devices and software from different vendors to work together.
- **Troubleshooting**: Helps isolate network issues layer by layer.
- **Modularity**: Each layer has a specific role, making it easier to develop and maintain networks.
