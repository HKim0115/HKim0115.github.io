## What is DNS?

DNS translates domain names (e.g., `tryhackme.com`) into IP addresses (e.g., `104.26.10.229`) so users don't need to memorize numerical addresses to access websites.

Every device on the internet has an IP address, and DNS acts like the internet's phonebook, resolving human-friendly domain names to machine-readable IPs.

## Domain Name Structure

### Top-Level Domain (TLD)
- The last segment of a domain name (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.co.uk`)
- Two types:
  - **gTLD (Generic Top-Level Domain)**: Represents purpose (`.com`, `.edu`, `.gov`)
  - **ccTLD (Country Code Top-Level Domain)**: Represents location (`.au`, `.jp`, `.uk`)

### Second-Level Domain (SLD)
- The part directly before the TLD (e.g., `tryhackme` in `tryhackme.com`)
- Can use a-z, 0-9, and hyphens (but not at the start or end), up to 63 characters

### Subdomain
- Precedes the SLD (e.g., `admin.tryhackme.com`)
- Multiple subdomains can be chained (`a.b.example.com`)
- Total domain length must be ≤ 253 characters

## DNS Record Types 

| Type    | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **A**   | Resolves a domain to an IPv4 address |
| **AAAA**| Resolves a domain to an IPv6 address |
| **CNAME** | Points one domain to another (alias) |
| **MX**  | Defines mail servers for the domain |
| **TXT** | Stores text-based data (e.g., SPF records) |

## How DNS Resolution Works

1. The client checks its local DNS cache.
2. If not found, it queries a **Recursive DNS Resolver** (typically provided by the ISP).
3. The resolver checks its cache. If unresolved:
    - Queries the **Root DNS Server**
    - Root server responds with the appropriate **TLD Server**
    - TLD server returns the **Authoritative Name Server**
    - Authoritative server returns the final IP address
4. The recursive resolver caches the result and returns it to the client.

Each DNS record has a **TTL (Time To Live)** indicating how long the result is stored in cache.

## Why Use CNAME Records?

CNAME (Canonical Name) records are useful when one domain should point to another domain instead of a specific IP. Common use cases include:

- **Simplified maintenance**: Multiple subdomains (e.g., `www`, `blog`) can point to one target. If the IP changes, only the target needs updating.
- **Third-party integration**: Platforms like GitHub Pages or Shopify often require domain linkage via CNAME.
- **Alias handling**: A domain like `store.example.com` can be a CNAME for `shops.shopify.com`.

Example:
store.example.com → shops.shopify.com

This setup allows flexible redirection and reduces manual updates across DNS records.
